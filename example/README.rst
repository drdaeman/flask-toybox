Flask-ToyBox example
====================

Sorry, no documentation yet.

The functionality is quite limited - write support is nearly non-existent.
This example app serves as a some sort of playground to me as I add features
to the library.

And, yes, some things may look ugly for now - they indeed are.
Subject to changes.
